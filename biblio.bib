  abstract={A new X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) full-field imaging station has been developed, installed and tested on beamline ID21 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The set-up operates in the 2-9 keV energy range and allows for the simultaneous acquisition of up to 4.10 6 XANES spectra over large sample areas with preserved sub-micron spatial resolution. The versatile set-up is compatible with various types of cameras and magnifying objectives. It accommodates spatial resolutions ranging from 0.3 ?m to 1.4 ?m and fields of view from 600 ?m up to 2 mm. The range of potential applications is broad: from geology, cultural heritage, environmental sciences to medicine.}

  abstract={2D area detectors like CCD or pixel detectors have become popular in the last 15 years for diffraction experiments (e.g. for WAXS, SAXS, single crystal and powder diffraction (XRPD)). These detectors have a large sensitive area of millions of pixels with high spatial resolution. The software package pyFAI has been designed to reduce SAXS, WAXS and XRPD images taken with those detectors into 1 D curves (azimuthal integration) usable by other software for in-depth analysis such as Rietveld refinement, or 2 D images (a radial transformation named caking ). As a library, the aim of pyFAI is to be integrated into other tools like PyMca or EDNA with a clean pythonic interface. However pyFAI features also command line tools for batch processing, converting data into q-space (q being the momentum transfer) or 2 ? -space ( ? being the Bragg angle) and a calibration graphical interface for optimizing the geometry of the experiment using the Debye-Scherrer rings of a reference sample. PyFAI shares the geometry definition of SPD but can directly import geometries determined by the software FIT2D. PyFAI has been designed to work with any kind of detector and geometry (transmission or reflection) and relies on FabIO, a library able to read more than 20 image formats produced by detectors from 12 different manufacturers. During the transformation from cartesian space (x,y) to polar space (2?, ?), both local and total intensities are conserved in order to obtain accurate quantitative results. Technical details on how this integration is implemented and how it has been ported to native code and parallelized on graphic cards are discussed in this paper.}

 abstract = {A method and apparatus for identifying scale invariant features in an image and a further method and apparatus for using such scale invariant features to locate an object in an image are disclosed. The method and apparatus for identifying scale invariant features may involve the use of a processor circuit for producing a plurality of component subregion descriptors for each subregion of a pixel region about pixel amplitude extrema in a plurality of difference images produced from the image. This may involve producing a plurality of difference images by blurring an initial image to produce a blurred image and by subtracting the blurred image from the initial image to produce the difference image. For each difference image, pixel amplitude extrema are located and a corresponding pixel region is defined about each pixel amplitude extremum. Each pixel region is divided into subregions and a plurality of component subregion descriptors are produced for each subregion. These component subregion descriptors are correlated with component subregion descriptors of an image under consideration and an object is indicated as being detected when a sufficient number of component subregion descriptors (scale invariant features) define an aggregate correlation exceeding a threshold correlation with component subregion descriptors (scale invariant features) associated with the object.}

abstract = {X-ray scattering experiments at synchrotron sources are characterized by large and constantly increasing amounts of data. The great number of files generated during a synchrotron experiment is often a limiting factor in the analysis of the data, since appropriate software is rarely available to perform fast and tailored data processing. Furthermore, it is often necessary to perform online data reduction and analysis during the experiment in order to interactively optimize experimental design. This article presents an open-source software package developed to process large amounts of data from synchrotron scattering experiments. These data reduction processes involve calibration and correction of raw data, one- or two-dimensional integration, as well as fitting and further analysis of the data, including the extraction of certain parameters. The software, {\it DPDAK} (directly programmable data analysis kit), is based on a plug-in structure and allows individual extension in accordance with the requirements of the user. The article demonstrates the use of {\it DPDAK} for on- and offline analysis of scanning small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data on biological samples and microfluidic systems, as well as for a comprehensive analysis of grazing-incidence SAXS data. In addition to a comparison with existing software packages, the structure of {\it DPDAK} and the possibilities and limitations are discussed.},

abstract = {With the rise in popularity of biological small-angle X-ray scattering (BioSAXS) measurements, synchrotron beamlines are confronted with an ever-increasing number of samples from a wide range of solution conditions. To meet these demands, an increasing number of beamlines worldwide have begun to provide automated liquid-handling systems for sample loading. This article presents an automated sample-loading system for BioSAXS beamlines, which combines single-channel disposable-tip pipetting with a vacuum-enclosed temperature-controlled capillary flow cell. The design incorporates an easily changeable capillary to reduce the incidence of X-ray window fouling and cross contamination. Both the robot-control and the data-processing systems are written in Python. The data-processing code, {\it RAW}, has been enhanced with several new features to form a user-friendly BioSAXS pipeline for the robot. The flow cell also supports efficient manual loading and sample recovery. An effective rinse protocol for the sample cell is developed and tested. Fluid dynamics within the sample capillary reveals a vortex ring pattern of circulation that redistributes radiation-damaged material. Radiation damage is most severe in the boundary layer near the capillary surface. At typical flow speeds, capillaries below 2mm in diameter are beginning to enter the Stokes (creeping flow) regime in which mixing due to oscillation is limited. Analysis within this regime shows that single-pass exposure and multiple-pass exposure of a sample plug are functionally the same with regard to exposed volume when plug motion reversal is slow. The robot was tested on three different beamlines at the Cornell High-Energy Synchrotron Source, with a variety of detectors and beam characteristics, and it has been used successfully in several published studies as well as in two introductory short courses on basic BioSAXS methods.},

A combined system including an auto-sampler robot and online high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been developed and optimized at the SWING beamline of Synchrotron SOLEIL (Gif-sur-Yvette, France). In the sample changer mode, a few microlitres of sample can be injected between two air bubbles and circulated at a controlled speed of typically 40{$\mu$}lmin${\sp {$-$}1}$. A maximum of 14 samples per hour could be measured in this mode by remote controlling the sample injections. In the HPLC mode, an initially polydisperse sample can be separated into each of its components before immediate data acquisition. The sample cell is thermostated, and offers a visualization control and online UV{--}Vis absorption monitoring.},

To optimize data quality and completeness, ISPyBB (ISPyB for BioSAXS) makes it simple for users to compare the results from new measurements with previous acquisitions from the same day or earlier experiments in order to maximize the ability to collect all data required in a single synchrotron visit. The graphical user interface (GUI) of ISPyBB has been designed to guide users in the preparation of an experiment. The input of sample information and the ability to outline the experimental aims in advance provides feedback on the number of measurements required, calculation of expected sample volumes and time needed to collect the data: all of this information aids the users to better prepare for their trip to the synchrotron. A prototype version of the ISPyBB database is now available at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) beamline BM29 and is already greatly appreciated by academic users and industrial clients. It will soon be available at the PETRA III beamline P12 and the Diamond Light Source beamlines I22 and B21.},

pages = {2059-2065}, 
year = {2006}, 
doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btl355}, 
abstract ={Motivation: A major problem for current peak detection algorithms is that noise in mass spectrometry (MS) spectra gives rise to a high rate of false positives. The false positive rate is especially problematic in detecting peaks with low amplitudes. Usually, various baseline correction algorithms and smoothing methods are applied before attempting peak detection. This approach is very sensitive to the amount of smoothing and aggressiveness of the baseline correction, which contribute to making peak detection results inconsistent between runs, instrumentation and analysis methods.Results: Most peak detection algorithms simply identify peaks based on amplitude, ignoring the additional information present in the shape of the peaks in a spectrum. In our experience, ‘true’ peaks have characteristic shapes, and providing a shape-matching function that provides a ‘goodness of fit’ coefficient should provide a more robust peak identification method. Based on these observations, a continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based peak detection algorithm has been devised that identifies peaks with different scales and amplitudes. By transforming the spectrum into wavelet space, the pattern-matching problem is simplified and in addition provides a powerful technique for identifying and separating the signal from the spike noise and colored noise. This transformation, with the additional information provided by the 2D CWT coefficients can greatly enhance the effective signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, with this technique no baseline removal or peak smoothing preprocessing steps are required before peak detection, and this improves the robustness of peak detection under a variety of conditions. The algorithm was evaluated with SELDI-TOF spectra with known polypeptide positions. Comparisons with two other popular algorithms were performed. The results show the CWT-based algorithm can identify both strong and weak peaks while keeping false positive rate low.Availability: The algorithm is implemented in R and will be included as an open source module in the Bioconductor project.Contact:s-lin2@northwestern.eduSupplementary material:http://basic.northwestern.edu/publications/peakdetection/.

Software exists to convert the two-dimensional powder diffraction patterns that are recorded by these detectors to one-dimensional diffractograms, which may be analysed by the broad variety of powder diffraction software developed by the crystallography community. However, employing these tools for the construction of crystalline phase distribution maps proves to be very difficult, especially when employing micro-focused X-ray beams, as most diffraction software tools have mainly been developed having structure solution in mind and are not suitable for phase imaging purposes. {\it XRDUA} has been developed to facilitate the execution of the complete sequence of data reduction and interpretation steps required to convert large sequences of powder diffraction patterns into a limited set of crystalline phase maps in an integrated fashion.},

  abstract = {Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS) experiments
	on solutions provide rapidly decaying scattering curves, often with
	a poor signal-to-noise ratio, especially at higher angles. On modern
	instruments, the noise is partially compensated for by oversampling,
	thanks to the fact that the angular increment in the data is small
	compared with that needed to describe adequately the local behaviour
	and features of the scattering curve. Given a (noisy) experimental
	data set, an important question arises as to which part of the data
	still contains useful information and should be taken into account
	for the interpretation and model building. Here, it is demonstrated
	that, for monodisperse systems, the useful experimental data range
	is defined by the number of meaningful Shannon channels that can
	be determined from the data set. An algorithm to determine this number
	and thus the data range is developed, and it is tested on a number
	of simulated data sets with various noise levels and with different
	degrees of oversampling, corresponding to typical SAXS/SANS experiments.
	The method is implemented in a computer program and examples of its
	application to analyse the experimental data recorded under various
	conditions are presented. The program can be employed to discard
	experimental data containing no useful information in automated pipelines,
	in modelling procedures, and for data deposition or publication.
	The software is freely accessible to academic users.},

abstract = {The automation of beam delivery, sample handling and data analysis, together with increasing photon flux, diminishing focal spot size and the appearance of fast-readout detectors on synchrotron beamlines, have changed the way that many macromolecular crystallography experiments are planned and executed. Screening for the best diffracting crystal, or even the best diffracting part of a selected crystal, has been enabled by the development of microfocus beams, precise goniometers and fast-readout detectors that all require rapid feedback from the initial processing of images in order to be effective. All of these advances require the coupling of data feedback to the experimental control system and depend on immediate online data-analysis results during the experiment. To facilitate this, a {\it Data Analysis WorkBench} ({\it DAWB}) for the flexible creation of complex automated protocols has been developed. Here, example workflows designed and implemented using {\it DAWB} are presented for enhanced multi-step crystal characterizations, experiments involving crystal re{\-}orientation with kappa goniometers, crystal-burning experiments for empirically determining the radiation sensitivity of a crystal system and the application of mesh scans to find the best location of a crystal to obtain the highest diffraction quality. Beamline users interact with the prepared workflows through a specific brick within the beamline-control GUI {\it MXCuBE}.},

abstract = {This article presents the main technical features and performance of the upgraded beamline ID02 at the ESRF. The beamline combines different small-angle X-ray scattering techniques in one unique instrument, enabling static and kinetic investigations from {\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}m to micrometre size scales and time resolution down to the sub-millisecond range. The main component of the instrument is an evacuated detector tube of length 34m and diameter 2m. Several different detectors are housed inside a motorized wagon that travels along a rail system, allowing an automated change of the sample{--}detector distance from about 1 to 31m as well as selection of the desired detector. For optional combined wide-angle scattering measurements, a wide-angle detector is installed at the entrance cone of the tube. A scattering vector (of magnitude {\it q}) range of 0.002 {$\leq$} {\it q} {$\leq$} 50nm${\sp {$-$}1}$ is covered with two sample{--}detector distances and a single-beam setting for an X-ray wavelength of 1{\AA}. In the high-resolution mode, two-dimensional ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering patterns down to {\it q} < 0.001nm${\sp {$-$}1}$ can be recorded, and the resulting one-dimensional profiles have superior quality as compared to those measured with an optimized Bonse{--}Hart instrument. In the highest-resolution mode, the beam is nearly coherent, thereby permitting multispeckle ultra-small-angle X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy measurements. The main applications of the instrument include the elucidation of static and transient hierarchical structures, and nonequilibrium dynamics in soft matter and biophysical systems.},

Deviations of the peak position from the theoretical position in dimensionless GPA plots can suggest parameter errors, problematic low-resolution data, some kinds of intermolecular interactions or elongated scatters. To facilitate automated analysis by GPA, the elongation ratio (ER), which is the ratio of the areas in the pair-distribution function {\it P}({\it r}) after and before the {\it P}({\it r}) maximum, was characterized; symmetric samples have ER values around 1, and samples with ER values greater than 5 tend to be outliers in GPA analysis.

The NeXus data format has two purposes. First, it defines a format that can serve as a container for all relevant data associated with a beamline. This is a very important use case. Second, it defines standards in the form of application definitions for the exchange of data between applications. NeXus provides structures for raw experimental data as well as for processed data.},

Data were collected at room temperature (RT) from crystals sandwiched between two silicon nitride wafers, thereby preventing their drying, while limiting background scattering and sample consumption. In order to identify crystal hits, new multi-processing and GUI-driven Python-based pre-analysis software was developed, named {\it NanoPeakCell}, that was able to read data from a variety of crystallographic image formats. Further data processing was carried out using {\it CrystFEL}, and the resultant structures were refined to 1.7{\AA} resolution. The data demonstrate the feasibility of RT raster-scanning serial micro- and nano-protein crystallography at synchrotrons and validate it as an alternative approach for the collection of high-resolution structural data from micro-sized crystals. Advantages of the proposed approach are its thriftiness, its handling-free nature, the reduced amount of sample required, the adjustable hit rate, the high indexing rate and the minimization of background scattering.},

Sorting of data according to different criteria and rapid filtering of events to retain only diffraction patterns of interest results in significant reductions in data volume, thereby simplifying subsequent data analysis and management tasks. Meanwhile the generation of reduced data in the form of virtual powder patterns, radial stacks, histograms and other meta data creates data set summaries for analysis and overall experiment evaluation. Rapid data reduction early in the analysis pipeline is proving to be an essential first step in serial imaging experiments, prompting the authors to make the tool described in this article available to the general community. Originally developed for experiments at X-ray free-electron lasers, the software is based on a modular facility-independent library to promote portability between different experiments and is available under version 3 or later of the GNU General Public License.},

Characterizing such complex materials with a high enough spatial resolution requires acquiring large amounts of diffraction images{,} followed by a complex sequence of data management to localize the crystalline phases in the sample. Here we propose to use multivariate analysis in order to automatically decompose the data in a small set of components{,} each representing the diffraction pattern of one or a small number of phases. This makes phase identification and quantification of each component much more efficient and leads to a quantitative knowledge of the phase content in each voxel of the tomographic reconstruction. We show that non-negative matrix factorization is very efficient for this purpose{,} with a computing time well compatible with in-line data analysis in order to assess the quality of measurements during experiments at synchrotron beamlines. Here{,} we apply the method to the investigation of microsamples from medieval applied brocade decors selected from a wooden statue{,} and the results are validated a posteriori by comparison with ex situ destructive techniques."

abstract = {With the advent of big data, we see an increasing interest in computing correlations
in huge data sets with both many instances and many variables. Essential descriptive
statistics such as the variance, standard deviation, covariance, and correlation can
suffer from a numerical instability known as "catastrophic cancellation" that can
lead to problems when naively computing these statistics with a popular textbook equation.
While this instability has been discussed in the literature already 50 years ago,
we found that even today, some high-profile tools still employ the instable version.In
this paper, we study a popular incremental technique originally proposed by Welford,
which we extend to weighted covariance and correlation. We also discuss strategies
for further improving numerical precision, how to compute such statistics online on
a data stream, with exponential aging, with missing data, and a batch parallelization
for both high performance and numerical precision.We demonstrate when the numerical
instability arises, and the performance of different approaches under these conditions.
We showcase applications from the classic computation of variance as well as advanced
applications such as stock market analysis with exponentially weighted moving models
and Gaussian mixture modeling for cluster analysis that all benefit from this approach.},

title = {Robust Chauvenet Outlier Rejection},
abstract = {Sigma clipping is commonly used in astronomy for outlier rejection, but the number of standard deviations beyond which one should clip data from a sample ultimately depends on the size of the sample. Chauvenet rejection is one of the oldest, and simplest, ways to account for this, but, like sigma clipping, it depends on the sample’s mean and standard deviation, neither of which are robust quantities: both are easily contaminated by the very outliers they are being used to reject. Many, more robust measures of central tendency, and of sample deviation, exist, but each has a trade-off with precision. Here we demonstrate that outlier rejection can be both very robust and very precise if decreasingly robust but increasingly precise techniques are applied in sequence. To this end, we present a variation on Chauvenet rejection that we call “robust” Chauvenet rejection (RCR), which uses three decreasingly robust/increasingly precise measures of central tendency and four decreasingly robust/increasingly precise measures of sample deviation. We show this sequential approach to be very effective for a wide variety of contaminant types, even when a significant—even dominant—fraction of the sample is contaminated, and especially when the contaminants are strong. Furthermore, we have developed a bulk-rejection variant, to significantly decrease computing times, and RCR can be applied both to weighted data and when fitting parameterized models to data. We present aperture photometry in a contaminated, crowded field as an example. RCR may be used by anyone at https://skynet.unc.edu/rcr, and source code is available there as well.}

title = {LImA2, a distributed acquisition system for the new ESRF-EBS Serial-MX 
beamline}, 
abstract = {With the advance of modular X-ray detector in terms of frame rate and 
size, the need for a scalable and portable Data Acquisition System (DAQ) 
to deal with the ever increasing data bandwidth is ubiquitous. 
Similarly, the extremely high data rates put limits on Data Storage that 
require Online Data Analysis (ODA) and Reduction (ODR).
In this work, we introduce LImA2, a distributed evolution of LImA[1], 
developed for the new ESRF-EBS Serial-MX beamline ID29. At ID29, the 
detector chosen, a PSI JungFrau-4M detector[2], is capable of generating 
up to 18.4 GB/s of raw data. In order to cope with this throughput, the 
data have to be reduced in real-time before they can be written to 
permanent storage. A dedicated processing data flow has been developed 
for both the detector specific frame reconstruction and the integration 
of online data reduction based on azimuthal integration[3] and 
Bragg-peak finding.
LImA2 is a distributed MPI application with control and data receivers 
processes that collaborate to perform the acquisition and the online 
processing. Scalability is achieved with increasing the number of 
receivers, eventually distributed on multiple computers. We support two 
configurations/topologies: partial frame dispatch (one receiver per 
detector module) and full frame dispatch (one receiver acquires a full 
detector frame).
Data receivers have two responsibilities: 1. DAQ, implemented on top of 
the vendor SDK with respect to the technology used (sockets, DPDK, 
RoCE); 2. ODA, instantiate a choice of processing graph, parallelizing 
and delegating to hardware accelerators tasks such as feature extraction 
and data visualization. Different accelerators are supported. For ID29, 
GPUs are used to perform gain/pedestal correction and azimuthal 
integration to generate the reduced dataset and IBM Power9 NX 
accelerators perform GZIP compression in real-time.},

abstract = { Protein crystallography has revolutionized our understanding of a whole variety of biological processes (see the Perspective by Evans). In crystallography, the measure of agreement between the data and the calculated model is not on the same scale as the measure of data quality, making it challenging to choose an optimal high resolution limit beyond which the data should be discarded. Now, Karplus and Diederichs (p. 1030) introduce a statistical model that assesses agreement of model and data accuracy on the same scale. Determining the structures of biological macromolecules by x-ray crystallography requires solving the phase problem. The two techniques that dominate phase evaluation (multi- and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction) rely on element-specific scattering from incorporated heavy atoms. Liu et al. (p. 1033) present procedures for routine structure determination of native proteins with no heavy atom incorporation. The technique, which relies on combining data from multiple crystals, was used to determine the structures of four native proteins, including a 1200-residue complex. A statistical method places model and data quality on the same scale and indicates how far one can model. In macromolecular x-ray crystallography, refinement R values measure the agreement between observed and calculated data. Analogously, Rmerge values reporting on the agreement between multiple measurements of a given reflection are used to assess data quality. Here, we show that despite their widespread use, Rmerge values are poorly suited for determining the high-resolution limit and that current standard protocols discard much useful data. We introduce a statistic that estimates the correlation of an observed data set with the underlying (not measurable) true signal; this quantity, CC*, provides a single statistically valid guide for deciding which data are useful. CC* also can be used to assess model and data quality on the same scale, and this reveals when data quality is limiting model improvement. }

abstract = {This article describes a free and open-source data analysis utility designed for fast online feedback during serial X-ray diffraction and scattering experiments: {\it OnDA} (online data analysis). Three complete real-time monitors for common types of serial X-ray imaging experiments are presented. These monitors are capable of providing the essential information required for quick decision making in the face of extreme rates of data collection. In addition, a set of modules, functions and algorithms that allow developers to modify the provided monitors or develop new ones are provided. The emphasis here is on simple, modular and scalable code that is based on open-source libraries and protocols. {\it OnDA} monitors have already proven to be invaluable tools in several experiments, especially for scoring and monitoring of diffraction data during serial crystallography experiments at both free-electron laser and synchrotron facilities. It is felt that in the future the kind of fast feedback that {\it OnDA} monitors provide will help researchers to deal with the expected very high throughput data flow at next-generation facilities such as the European X-ray free-electron laser.},

abstract = {High-resolution structural information was obtained from lysozyme microcrystals (20{$\mu$}m in the largest dimension) using raster-scanning serial protein crystallography on micro- and nano-focused beamlines at the ESRF. Data were collected at room temperature (RT) from crystals sandwiched between two silicon nitride wafers, thereby preventing their drying, while limiting background scattering and sample consumption. In order to identify crystal hits, new multi-processing and GUI-driven Python-based pre-analysis software was developed, named {\it NanoPeakCell}, that was able to read data from a variety of crystallographic image formats. Further data processing was carried out using {\it CrystFEL}, and the resultant structures were refined to 1.7{\AA} resolution. The data demonstrate the feasibility of RT raster-scanning serial micro- and nano-protein crystallography at synchrotrons and validate it as an alternative approach for the collection of high-resolution structural data from micro-sized crystals. Advantages of the proposed approach are its thriftiness, its handling-free nature, the reduced amount of sample required, the adjustable hit rate, the high indexing rate and the minimization of background scattering.},

      abstract     = {X-ray crystallography provides the vast majority of
                      macromolecular structures, but the success of the method
                      relies on growing crystals of sufficient size. In
                      conventional measurements, the necessary increase in X-ray
                      dose to record data from crystals that are too small leads
                      to extensive damage before a diffraction signal can be
                      recorded. It is particularly challenging to obtain large,
                      well-diffracting crystals of membrane proteins, for which
                      fewer than 300 unique structures have been determined
                      despite their importance in all living cells. Here we
                      present a method for structure determination where
                      single-crystal X-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected
                      from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using
                      femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser,
                      the Linac Coherent Light Source. We prove this concept with
                      nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane
                      protein complexes. More than 3,000,000 diffraction patterns
                      were collected in this study, and a three-dimensional data
                      set was assembled from individual photosystem I nanocrystals
                      (∼200 nm to 2 μm in size). We mitigate the problem of
                      radiation damage in crystallography by using pulses briefer
                      than the timescale of most damage processes. This offers a
                      new approach to structure determination of macromolecules
                      that do not yield crystals of sufficient size for studies

The new EIGER detector features a pixel size of 75 {$\times$} 75{$\mu$}m, frame rates of up to 3000Hz and a dead time as low as 3.8{$\mu$}s. An EIGER 1M and EIGER 16M were tested on Swiss Light Source beamlines X10SA and X06SA for their application in macromolecular crystallography. The combination of fast frame rates and a very short dead time allows high-quality data acquisition in a shorter time. The ultrafine {$\varphi$}-slicing data-collection method is introduced and validated and its application in finding the optimal rotation angle, a suitable rotation speed and a sufficient X-ray dose are presented. An improvement of the data quality up to slicing at one tenth of the mosaicity has been observed, which is much finer than expected based on previous findings. The influence of key data-collection parameters on data quality is discussed.},

Geometrically, a JUNGFRAU readout chip consists of 256×256 pixels of 75×75 μm2. The chips are bump bonded to 320 μm thick silicon sensors. Arrays of 2×4 chips are tiled to form modules of 4×8 cm2 area. Several multi-module systems with up to 16 Mpixels per system will be delivered to the two end stations at SwissFEL. The JUNGFRAU full scale readout ASIC and module design are presented along with characterization results of the first systems. Experiments from fluorescence X-ray, visible light illumination, and synchrotron irradiation are shown. The results include an electronic noise of ∼50 electrons r.m.s., which enables single photon detection energies below 2 keV and a noise well below the Poisson statistical limit over the entire dynamic range.

abstract = {Serial crystallography records still diffraction patterns from single, randomly oriented crystals, then merges data from hundreds or thousands of them to form a complete data set. To process the data, the diffraction patterns must first be indexed, equivalent to determining the orientation of each crystal. A novel automatic indexing algorithm is presented, which in tests usually gives significantly higher indexing rates than alternative programs currently available for this task. The algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the lattice parameters but can make use of that information if provided, and also allows indexing of diffraction patterns generated by several crystals in the beam. Cases with a small number of Bragg spots per pattern appear to particularly benefit from the new approach. The algorithm has been implemented and optimized for fast execution, making it suitable for real-time feedback during serial crystallography experiments. It is implemented in an open-source C++ library and distributed under the LGPLv3 licence. An interface to it has been added to the {\it CrystFEL} software suite.},

It can be used in a variety of contexts including measurements made with a monochromatic radiation source, a polychromatic source or with radiation of very short wavelength. As such, the algorithm is particularly suited to automated data processing for two emerging measurement techniques for macromolecular structure determination: serial pink-beam X-ray crystallography and serial electron crystallography, which until now lacked reliable programs for analyzing many individual diffraction patterns from crystals of uncorrelated orientation. The algorithm requires approximate knowledge of the unit-cell parameters of the crystal, but not the wavelengths associated with each Bragg spot. The use of {\it pinkIndexer} is demonstrated by obtaining 1005 lattices from a published pink-beam serial crystallography data set that had previously yielded 140 indexed lattices. Additionally, in tests on experimental serial crystallography diffraction data recorded with quasi-monochromatic X-rays and with electrons the algorithm indexed more patterns than other programs tested.},

Traditional synchrotron crystallography methods are thus less well suited to still image data processing. Here, a new indexing method is presented with the aim of maximizing information use from a still image given the known unit-cell dimensions and space group. Efficacy for cubic, hexagonal and orthorhombic space groups is shown, and for those showing some evidence of diffraction the indexing rate ranged from 90% (hexagonal space group) to 151% (cubic space group).

abstract = {A peak-finding algorithm for serial crystallography (SX) data analysis based on the principle of `robust statistics' has been developed. Methods which are statistically robust are generally more insensitive to any departures from model assumptions and are particularly effective when analysing mixtures of probability distributions. For example, these methods enable the discretization of data into a group comprising inliers ({\it i.e.} the background noise) and another group comprising outliers ({\it i.e.} Bragg peaks). Our robust statistics algorithm has two key advantages, which are demonstrated through testing using multiple SX data sets. First, it is relatively insensitive to the exact value of the input parameters and hence requires minimal optimization. This is critical for the algorithm to be able to run unsupervised, allowing for automated selection or `vetoing' of SX diffraction data. Secondly, the processing of individual diffraction patterns can be easily parallelized. This means that it can analyse data from multiple detector modules simultaneously, making it ideally suited to real-time data processing. These characteristics mean that the robust peak finder (RPF) algorithm will be particularly beneficial for the new class of MHz X-ray free-electron laser sources, which generate large amounts of data in a short period of time.},

The program is based on the fast on-line determination of single-crystal orientations from Kikuchi and spot patterns. Spot patterns, which are particularly useful in the case of highly deformed metals, are analyzed by a new digital image processing procedure. This procedure improves the precision and ease of the orientation measurement. The program permits the on-line measurement of glide systems characterized by the Burgers vector and the crystallographic line direction of dislocations and their glide planes. The determination of twin systems, based on the misorientation calculation for any crystal structure, is included as well. The possibility of determining the foil thickness permits the complete crystallographic characterization of interfaces. Finally, the program facilitates the discrimination of phases and includes the fit of the lattice parameters {\it a}, {\it b} and {\it c} from diffraction patterns. The new procedures are described in detail. Application examples are given for all functions.},
